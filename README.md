# utah-rcv-invalid-votes

The project aims to identify invalid and misused vote rates through raw cast votes data in an election using RCV, to be compared to a global norm of invalid rates in other voting systems. The code includes cleaning code for generating the variables for the types of invalid and misused vote patterns. Then, summary tables and visualizations are presented to get a sense of the distribution of invalid and misused vote rates.  
**This analysis is part of a larger research project on voter comprehension of ranked choice voting.**
